The addon allows to export camera poses and vertex positions to a few photogrammetry formats.
Currently, the addon supports:

- Colmap model folders
- NVM files of VisualSFM

Select all cameras and objects you want to export. For each selected mesh the vertices are stored as points in the output file/folder. Use :code:`File/Export/<Export Function>` to export the corresponding file.
